# FileDiff - Text File Comparison Tool

A lightweight, web-based tool for comparing two text files and visually highlighting differences between them. Built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - no server-side processing required.

## 🌟 Features

- **Dual File Upload**: Upload two text files for comparison
- **Direct Text Input**: Paste text directly into input areas
- **Visual Diff Highlighting**: Added lines (green) and removed lines (red)
- **Multiple Format Support**: Works with .txt, .js, .html, .css, .py, .java, .cpp, .c, .cs, .php files
- **Statistics**: Shows total lines, added lines, and removed lines
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **RTL Support**: Full support for right-to-left languages like Persian
- **Zero Dependencies**: Pure client-side implementation

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser
3. Upload two text files or paste text into both panels
4. Click the "Compare Files" button
5. View the differences highlighted in the results section

## 📁 Supported File Types

- Text files (.txt)
- Code files: JavaScript (.js), HTML (.html), CSS (.css)
- Programming languages: Python (.py), Java (.java), C++ (.cpp), C (.c), C# (.cs), PHP (.php)

## 🛠️ How It Works

The tool uses a line-by-line comparison algorithm to detect differences between two text inputs. The algorithm:

1. Splits both texts into arrays of lines
2. Compares each line sequentially
3. Identifies added, removed, and unchanged lines
4. Formats the results with color-coded visual indicators
